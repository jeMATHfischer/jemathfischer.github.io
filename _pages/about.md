I am a mathematician with a focus on statistical mechanics and associated Markov chains, and its applications to graph theory, combinatorics as well as the social sciences. Nonetheless, I enjoyed every part of mathematics I have encountered so far. I obtained my Doctorat in mathematics in a collaboration between the University of Potsdam, Germany, and the Universit√© Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, France, with support from the french-german university DFH/UFA. You can find my Thesis online or **soon here** in a newer version with less typos. Many parts of this page will discuss mathematical subjects which are also inspired by my activity as a quantiative consultant. I share some open mathematical ideas in my <a url="/portfolio/">Open Science Projects</a>.
