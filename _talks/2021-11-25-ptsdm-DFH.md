I presented a theoretical framework for absorption times for generalized exclusion processes in random absorbing environments on a graph motivated by the Echo Chamber Model as an example. I discussed the dependency on the underlying graph structure relativ to the structure of the induced subgraph of the absorbing sites. I gave a general upper bound, combining the quasi-stationary distribution of the processes with an extended notion of Token graphs and quantified its quality for a special case of the Echo Chamber Model.
