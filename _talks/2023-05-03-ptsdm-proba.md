I discussed an approach based on self-avoiding exclusion processes inspired by swarm/genetic algorithms to explore high dimensional grids. Those are considered now as one option in post-quantum cryptography and pose interesting problems for self-avoiding exlcusion processes which form a natural extension of a self-avoiding random walk. The possible particle transitions, I discussed, left the next neighbor structure of graphs behind them and focused on transitions based on a given lattice basis and geometrically distributed jump lengths in one randomly picked direction. This talk used many notions from my thesis but applied in a completely different field.
