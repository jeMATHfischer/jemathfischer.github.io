I presented a negativ result concerning the reversibility of some generalized exclusion processes due to the strong lokal dependencies on the structure of the underlying discrete state space. Using combinatorical methods I showed that for a fixed transition structure, possible state spaces can be separated into two classes based on the reversibility property of the exclusion process. Both classes are completely defined by solutions of a Diphontine equation of order four in four variables, which encodes cycles of length four of the process.
