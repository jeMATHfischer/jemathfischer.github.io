The content of this talk was a summary of my research work of my PhD up to this point with a focus on the necessity to employ algebraic, combinatoric and graph theoretic techniques to answer questions regarding generalized exclusion processes associated to opinions dynamics. I explained the difficulties one might encounter while using functional analytical technqiues based on Eigenvalues of some associated operator and the trade-off I had to accept between the two points of view.
